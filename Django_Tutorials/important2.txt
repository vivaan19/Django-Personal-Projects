This is about How to Make Websites Using bootstrap and handle with django. 

1. Use of template inheritance, this means that we can extend the features of a base template
    including its own and adding our own. 
Ex: 
-->Base_Template.html 
   --> extend1.html
   --> extend2.html
   --> extend3.html
Here it means that Base_Template.html is serving as a base template for all extend htmls. 
The function can be extended in base by code blocks provided by django. 

2. How to submit the form, means that the data after clicking submit button the data will be stored in the 
data base. 
    Steps: 
    a. First in the form tag use the attribute "method" and give "post" value to it, method = "post". 
    b. Then use "action" attribute which is used for who will handle the submission, in this case we are 
        submitting through the contact page itself, so action="/contact". 
    c. Then add the csrf token for security after the form tag {% csrf_token %}. 
    d. Then after submitting the form, nothing will happen as because we have not set our database. 
    e. After submitting it will go to app urls.py and then to views.py , now inside the view we have add our logic 
        to submit the form. 
    f. In order to do so, we have to work with models and import that model to views. 
    g. Go to models and create a class named contact(models.Model) and inside it define all the form filds viz
        name, email, phone. The name of every field should be used here. 
    h. Then give all form fields value as django fields, means that what type of data should be associated and stored in
       database according to that field. 
        Ex: name = models.CharField(maxlength=122)
            email = models.CharField(maxlength=122)
            phone = models.CharField(maxlength=12)
            desc = models.TextField(maxlength=122) 
        this bascially means that contact is a table and these are the coloums in it. 
    i. Then register this model in admin.py: first import contact from models, then register it. 
        Ex: from <app_name>.models import <table_name>
            admin.site.register(<table_name>)
    j. Then go to app.py copy <application_name>Config and paste it in the setting.py in installed apps as: 
        <application_name>.apps.HomeConfig
    k. Then run the server through manage.py runserver and makemigrations. 
        Ex: python manage.py runserver
            python manage.py makemigrations
        makemigrations will generate a changed migration file for the database.
    l. Then do python manage.py migrate this will make changes to the database.  
    m. Then in views in contact we have to add our logic : 
        if request.method == "POST":
            name = request.POST.get("name")
            email = request.POST.get("email")
            phone = request.POST.get("phone")
            desc = request.POST.get("desc")
        then import contact class from models
        and make a object of contact by:
        contact=contact(name="name", phone="phone", email="email", desc="desc", date="datetime.today()")
        then save the contact object by:
        contact.save()
    o. after this in database the entires would be reflected as object1, object2.etc but if 
        we want name of instead of objects we have to add a function in model.py as:

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
