This was about basic Django Web Usage. 

1.To start a project in django 
django-admin startproject <Name_of_project>
This will create a folder of project_name and in it 
exact project_name folder consists of important things of how to make a project. 
Ex: I created "Sample" project. 

2. To run django server
python manage.py runserver,
it will return the host name where website is hosted.  
Search the host_name in brower.

3. Django runs on MVT (Model View Template) Arch.  

-> Model : Contains the info of how to create a database. It is meta data for a database. 

-> View : Associated with Template. It pulls data from database i.e form model, processes 
the data and pushes to template.

-> Template : It is mainly HTML, CSS, JS but it has placeholders as view gives data to template, 
as python variable, to see the output placeholders are their. 

4. The work of URL dispacher is to fetch link stored in database and retrive data from it. 

5. Any Django project has atleast one app in it for working.
Ex: There is a website and in it there are multiple apps webpages for differnt works, the main URL is same
but after it we can add differnt webpages. 

6. To create a app in a project in django use : 
python manage.py startapp <name_of_app>
This will create a folder of the app in which all things are there to work on it. 

7. To see the subcommands for django use : 
python manage.py 
this will help to run commands if you forget the name of it. 

8. There is url.py file in django which tracks of all url stored there and where it is redirecting.
Ex: urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
This means that if we add /admin to main url, then that will redirect to the default admin 
page of django.
We can add multiple urlpatterns in this.

9. To change django default home page to some other page, we have to follow these steps:
    a. first make a app in project folder.

    b. make a urls.py file in app, and copy the content of project urls.py
    
    c. In project urls.py add the path("", include("<app_name>.urls")) after path admin. 
        this means that in home page the contents will be redirected to app_name.urls.
    
    d. Then come to app urls.py, import view from app_name, inside urlpatterns remove admin one 
        and add the blank page one i.e : path("", views.index, name=<app_name>)
    
    e. Then go to views.py in app folder, add a function called index pass a parameter and import HttpResponse
        and then return HttpResponse("<The required message at the home page>")
    
    f. After these steps go to same django home page and relode, you will see the required text. 

10. Static files are those files which anybody can see when they visit the url. 
So here does not put any confidencial information. 

11. There is a STATIC_URL = '/static/' in setting which is used to access static pages in our
directory. 

12. To create static pages do the following steps : 
    a. First create a static folder in main project and add some static content like: txt, image
    b. In setting go to the documentation of static and copy "STATICFILES_DIRS" this defines
        where is static directory in parent project. 
    c. Now we are creating only one static file so clear the var/www/static line.
    d. Paste the code after static in setting. 
    e. And run the server and test by url/static/<static_file.txt>
    f. We can see the file is visible to us directly.

13. Static is only for public use and public can see it. 

14. Moving to templates, in this we create the front of website, it has mainly HTML, CSS, JS.
We have to integrate with bootstrap in order to create beautiful webpages. 

15. Using template : 
    a. Go to settings-->template-->dirs copy "[BASE_DIR / "<name_of_template_folder>"]" in the dirs list.
        it will tell django that template directory is in base directory which is main project dir.
    
    b. Add an index.html file in template dir. Add some content in it.

    c. Then in views use render("requests", <template_name>) to set views.

16. Send variables to a template : 
Steps:
    a. First put {{ varibale }} placeholder in the HTML body.
    b. In views make a dictionary of name let say content and add variable_name as key and
        its content as value.
    c. In the required function add the third parameter of render as the name of dictionary i.e content here.
    d. save it and run the server. 

17. Use of bootstrap - use a starter file form bootstrap and paste in template. 

18. Paste the code of navigation from bootstrap to the file in template. 

19. Python manage.py makemigrations  : check any changes in the data base schema. 

20. python manage.py migrate : imports some of the django tables for authentication. 

21. To make a super user for django admin authentication.
python manage.py createsuperuser

22. To change header, title, index titile in admin page add :: 
admin.site.site_header = ""
admin.site.site_title = ""
admin.site.index_title = ""
in main priject urls file.
Admin page is the main backend for a website, all data will be stored here.
